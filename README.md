## News Content API

I am attemping to port my [capstone project](https://github.com/osterburg/news-content-capstone-project) about news content to an API and a dashboard. Not sure right now if I am going to use [plotly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) or something else like [elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html).

### Goal(s): 
1. Port code
2. Prettify if it isn't
3. Build DL for `content` and `context`
4. Be able to display accuracy in percentile
5. Be able to display pyLDAvis (topics)
6. Build dashboard
